# Vadrifts.byp
## Advanced Roblox Chat Bypasser (Established 2022)

Vadrifts.byp is a Roblox chat bypasser originally created in December 2022 by **vqmpjay**, making it one of the oldest and most established chat bypass systems. The project became widely known throughout 2023 for its stability, consistent bypassing results, and legitimate appearance.

After the original servers and owner account were removed, the project went offline. It has now been fully restored, rewritten, and is actively maintained with improved features and updated methods.

Vadrifts.byp focuses on safe, reliable, and legitimate-looking Roblox chat bypassing. The system avoids suspicious behavior while providing one of the most complete bypass libraries available.
